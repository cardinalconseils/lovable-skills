# Authentication & Authorization

## Pattern Selection

| Pattern | Best For | Trade-off |
|---------|----------|----------|
| Session-based (cookies) | Server-rendered apps, same-domain | Requires server-side session store |
| JWT (stateless tokens) | APIs, mobile clients, microservices | Cannot revoke without blocklist |
| OAuth2 / OIDC | Third-party login, delegated auth | Complex setup, redirect flows |
| Magic links | Passwordless, low-friction signup | Depends on email delivery |

## Common Flows

1. **Signup**: validate input → hash password (bcrypt/argon2, cost ≥ 10) → store user → send verification email → return session/token
2. **Login**: find user by email → compare hash → create session/token → set httpOnly cookie or return token
3. **Logout**: destroy session server-side → clear cookie → invalidate refresh token
4. **Password reset**: verify email exists → generate time-limited token → send reset link → validate token → hash new password → invalidate all sessions
5. **MFA (TOTP)**: user enables MFA → generate secret → user scans QR → verify first code → store secret → require code on future logins

## Password Security

- Hash with **bcrypt** (cost 10+) or **argon2id** — never MD5, SHA, or plaintext
- Minimum 8 characters, no maximum below 128 (NIST 800-63B)
- Check against breached password lists (Have I Been Pwned API)
- Never log passwords, even hashed

## Session Security

- Store session tokens in **httpOnly, Secure, SameSite=Lax** cookies
- Implement CSRF protection (double-submit cookie or synchronizer token)
- Rotate session tokens after login (prevent session fixation)
- Set reasonable expiry: 15–30 min for sensitive apps, 7–30 days with refresh tokens

## RBAC Basics

- Define roles (admin, editor, viewer) with explicit permissions
- Check permissions in middleware — never in UI alone
- Default deny: no role = no access
- Add a `role` column from day one, even if you only have one role now

## Provider Recommendations

| Stack | Recommended Providers |
|-------|----------------------|
| Next.js | NextAuth.js, Clerk, Supabase Auth |
| React SPA + API | Auth0, Firebase Auth, Supabase Auth |
| Express/Node API | Passport.js, custom JWT, Clerk Backend |
| Full-stack Rails/Django | Built-in auth (Devise, django.contrib.auth) |

## Common Rationalizations

| Rationalization | Reality |
|---|---|
| "We'll add auth later" | Every endpoint is public until auth exists. "Later" means users see each other's data. |
| "Basic auth is fine for now" | Basic auth sends credentials on every request in a reversible encoding. Use sessions or tokens. |
| "We don't need roles yet" | Adding roles after launch requires migrating every user. Add the role field now. |
| "We'll just use localStorage for tokens" | localStorage is accessible to any XSS. Use httpOnly cookies for session tokens. |

## Red Flags

- Passwords stored in plaintext or with MD5/SHA
- Tokens in localStorage instead of httpOnly cookies
- No CSRF protection on state-changing endpoints
- Missing rate limiting on login endpoint
- Session tokens that never expire or rotate
- Permissions checked only in the frontend

## Verification

- [ ] Passwords hashed with bcrypt (cost ≥ 10) or argon2id
- [ ] Session tokens stored in httpOnly, Secure, SameSite cookies
- [ ] CSRF protection enabled on all state-changing routes
- [ ] Login endpoint has rate limiting
- [ ] Password reset tokens expire within 1 hour
- [ ] Session tokens rotate after successful login
- [ ] Role/permission checks happen server-side, not just UI
- [ ] No credentials logged anywhere
- [ ] Email verification flow implemented for signup
- [ ] Refresh token rotation implemented if using JWTs
